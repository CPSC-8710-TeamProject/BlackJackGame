### Game Objective

The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

• Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural") without a dealer blackjack;

• Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21.

• Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21 ("busted").

### Rules

_Card Values:_

• Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.

• Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are worth 10 points each.

• Aces can be worth 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player more.

_Winning Conditions:_

• If a player is dealt a hand with a total value of 21 using two cards (an Ace and a 10-value card), they achieve a "blackjack" and typically win 1.5 times their original bet (if playing with money), unless the dealer also has a blackjack.

• If neither the player nor the dealer has a blackjack, the player wins if their hand's total value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without going over 21.
